Since it's a copy machine, she won't be able to pick the combination that would yield the highest chip value. So she would have to pick between a pair of purple fruit and a pair of yellow pepper. A pair of yellow pepper gives $1 more than the other pair, so she would choose yellow pepper.

She would still pick pepper because a pair of yellow pepper gives her one more dollar than a pair of purple fruit.
