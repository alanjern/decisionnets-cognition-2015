Experiments 1 and 2 model code
==============================

Model predictions for both models in Experiment 1 and for the decision net model in Experiment 2 were computed by hand. The model predictions can be seen in `analyzeresults.m` in the Data Analysis folder.

`bnet_structurelearningmodel.m` generates Bayes net model predictions for Experiment 2. This script uses the [Bayes Net Toolbox](https://code.google.com/p/bnt/).
