Round 5: The final two shapes have been different for all the rounds so it's very likely it would be the second card and it's getting less likely it would be the first.
Round 6: The chances he would make a mistake twice is very low, so I made the third card very unlikely.

-- Condition 1 --
Round 1: Same as the reasoning to begin last trial.
Round 2: Chances have changed, but not enough to lower change likelyhood scores.
Round 3: Now more likely it was the card with 3 windows, as maximizing score for 3 rounds would be lucky for the other two cards.
Round 4: Chances have changed, but not enough to change likelyhood scores.
Round 5: Same as last response
Round 6: To have maximzed the score for all six rounds makes it very unlikely the cards with 1 and two windows are being used as that would require extreme luck. Won't give scores of 1 or 7 because to me those correspond to certainty, but all 3 cards are still theoretically possible.
Round 7: Same as before.
Round 8: Same as before.
Round 9: Same as before.
Round 10: Same as before. Again, the likelyhood of playing with cards with one or two windows is very very small, but I reserve a score of 1 to mean impossible given logical play. The same argument applies to why I didn't choose 7 for the card with 3 windows.
-- Condition 2 --
Round 1: The chances of choosing the shape maximizing points with only 1 window are smaller than the chances of shoosing the shape maximizing points with 2 windows, which are smaller than the chances of choosing the correct shape with all 3 windows.
Round 2: No new information
Round 3: To have picked the card to maximize points 3 times in a row makes it very unlikley he has the card with 1 window, as that would require great luck. The probability is slightly higher for the card with two windows, must it is most likely the card with 3 windows.
Round 4: Ok, so can't be the card with 3 windows that the chosen shape would be illogical. The card with two windows is still more likely than the card with 1 window though.
Round 5: From the last round, it can't be the card with 3 windows. There is no new information to decide between the other two cards.
Round 6: No new information
Round 7: To have chosen a (third) shape to be different than the second shape for 7 rounds is very unlikely, so it is very unlikely it is the card with 1 window. Already ruled out card with 3 windows, so it is very likely the card with two windows.
Round 8: No new information.
Round 9: No new information
Round 10: No new information. Didn't choose 2 for card with one window because it was still theoretically possible, and to me choosing 1 for likelyhood means impossible. Similarly didn't choose 7 for likelyhood of card with two windows, as it was possible it was the card with 1 window, and to me 7 means it must be the card.
-- Condition 3 --
Round 1: Chances of choosing correct shape with one windows is less than that of choosing correct shape with card with two windows which is less than that choosing correct shape with 3 windows.
Round 2: No new information. (Actually the chances of it being the card with 1 window and two windows are less), but not enough to choose a lower likelyhood score.
Round 3: Now the chances are lowerd enough I'm willing to choose a lowe score for 1 and two windows, and thus higher for 3 windows.
Round 4: Well, not it can't be 3 windows, as that would be illogical. Chances of choosing the card with 2 windows is higher than the chances of choosing the card with 1 window, although both are possible yet.
Round 5: Not enough trials yet to lower likelyhood of 1 window card.
Round 6: After 6 rounds, it is most likely the card with two windows, as it would be very lucky to have chosen a (third) shape different than the second shape for all six rounds if playing with the first card.
Round 7: No new information.
Round 8: Must be using the first card, as the chosen shape would be illogical for the other two.

-- Condition 3 --
Round 1: The final shape chosen would be correct for any card.
Round 2: The final shape chosen would be correct for any card.
Round 3: Now that I think more about it more, it would be unusual to always pick a third different shape for the card with only 1 window because it really doesn't matter which shape is chosen. If the card with 1 window was being used, there would probably be more end games with duplicate shapes. Same argument applies to the second card, just to a lesser extent (there will be fewer duplicates).
Round 4: Picking card with 3 windows would lose the game, so he very likely did not pick that one. Then the other two remaining cards are equally likely.
Round 5: Because of the last game where it would be illogical to choose the card with 3 windows, I'm assuming that one is not being used, so it will get a likelyhood of 1 for the rest of the game.
Round 6: No new information
Round 7: No new information.
Round 8: Picking the card with two windows would be illogical, as no points would be awarded. Therefore, because I already rulsed out the card with 3 windows, he must be using the card with 1 window.
Round 9: I know the answer from last round.
Round 10: Know the answer from the last round.

Round 1: There's not renough data yet to make a pattern, so it's likely that he could've just guessed and got it right.

Round 3: Same as the last explanation, but with three correct choices in a row. That's, if I'm thinking correctly, only like a three percent chance for the first card. 
Round 4: This round pretty much eliminates the chance that he was using the third card, because he would have to deliberately fail if he was. This means there's a greater chance that he's using each of the first two. 
Round 5: The correct choice means there is a higher chance of him using the second card.

Round 1: Well, with the one-open card, it will be fairly likely that he would choose any of the cards, so unless Miles establishes a non-random pattern that I witness, I'll likely always pick 5 for the one-empty card. If the card was two-empty, Miles would have made a correct decision, but it was one of two correct decisions, while in the three empty case he made the only correct decision.
Round 2: Same as before.
Round 3: Same as before.
Round 4: Becoming a bit less likely that Miles always happens to pick the answer that works for both the 2 empty and 3 empty cases.
Round 5: No new information.
Round 6: No new information
Round 7: At this point it seems likely that Miles has the three empty card, because in all 7 cases he picks the only correct answer for the three empty card.
Round 8: Same as before, but becoming increasingly less likely that it's the one or two empty card cases.
Round 9: Becoming increasingly less likely still.
Round 10: Seems very probable that he had the 3 empty card case.
-- Condition 2 --
Round 1: Same reasoning as first round for Miles.
Round 2: No new information.
Round 3: No new information.
Round 4: Now seems entirely unlikely that Rachel has the three empty card, picked one of the two correct answers for the two empty card. 
Round 5: No new information.
Round 6: No new information. 
Round 7: Out of 7 cases has never picked the same card as the middle card, so becoming more likely that it's the 2 empty case.
Round 8: Same reasoning as before, becoming increasingly less likely that it's the one card case.
Round 9: Same reasoning as before.
Round 10: Same reasoning as before; out of 10 cases she never picked the same card as in the middle case. 
-- Condition 3 --
Round 1: Same reasoning as before.
Round 2: No new information.
Round 3: No new information. 
Round 4: No longer likely that it's the three empty case, still likely that it's either of the first two cases. 
Round 5: Same reasoning as before
Round 6: Same reasoning as before. 
Round 7: Becoming less likely that it's the one empty case, because in 7 rounds, he never picked the same card as the middle case. 
Round 8: Now since he has picked the same card as the middle case, he doesn't have two empty card. Also, for the first four rounds he picked different cards, and for the last four rounds he's only picked square, which I find weird because square was the furthest card from the submit button when I played, which implies that he's doing boredom wrong. 
Round 9: Now he's doing boredom correctly.
Round 10: Same as before.

Round 8: The only correct answer for the two card game has been given 3 tiems in a row, which makes it comparably more likely than the one card case.
Round 9: No new information.
Round 10: No new information.
-- Condition 3 --
Round 1: A circle in the last box would be the correct answer for any of the three cards, but it is the only correct answer for the all empty card.
Round 2: Same pattern as before, not enough iterations have occured yet to really confirm that she's using the all empty card.
Round 3: Same pattern; still wouldn't be surprising if she was actually using either of the first two cards.
Round 4: Assuming Susan understands the rules of the game, it's no longer likely at all that she's using the all empty card, but could still be using either the one empty or two empty cards. 
Round 5: Same reasoning, no new information.
Round 6: Same reasoning, no new information.
Round 7: Same reasoning, no new information.
Round 8: This card demonstrates that as long as Susan is a perfect player, she can't be using the two empty card.
Round 9: Same reasoning.
Round 10: Same reasoning.

Round 2: correct answer, still more likely that he has all 3
Round 3: no change, still thinking he has all 3 windows
Round 4: no change that he has 3 windows. so by elimination, increased possibility of other two. probably doesn't have just 1 dindow, based on first 3 rounds
Round 5: decreasing probability of 1 window. 3 window still ruled out
Round 6: no change, this doesnt provide evidence to differntiate between 1 window and 2 windows
Round 7: no change
Round 8: no change
Round 9: no change
Round 10: no change, tho probably has 2 windows, 1 is relatively more possible than 3 windows which is virtually impossible so i didnt want to rate both the same

Round 1: can't tell much from only 1 round, but quite increasing likelihood of correct answer with more windows.
Round 2: even more likely that he had all 3 windows open when he got both correct
Round 3: even more unlikely, but remotely possible for both
Round 4: entirely unlikely that he is playing the 3window version, increasing probability of other two by default, but still a greater likelihood of 2 than 1

-- Condition 1 --
Round 1: Unusual to get all three right if playing the first version. 
Round 2: Same reason as before. 
Round 3: Same reason as before. If he's consistently getting it right - choosing different shapes - likely because he has an "easier" version. 
Round 4: I decreased the chances for the first version to 1 becuase Miles has now gotten four consecutive rounds correct. This would be highly unusual for the card where you can only see one box.  
Round 5: Same as before.
Round 6: Same as before.
Round 7: I increased the chances for the third version to level 7. It is unlikely (not extremely unlikely, but generally unlikely) that you could get seven consecutively correct.
Round 8: same as before.
Round 9: same as before.
Round 10: Same as before.
-- Condition 2 --
Round 1: he got it right - probably not the first version. 
Round 2: same. 
Round 3: has now got three consecutively correct - probably not the first one. 
Round 4: definitely not the third one - he got something wrong. 
Round 5: same
Round 6: probably not the first one - has gotten too many correct to be playing that game. 
Round 7: same
Round 8: same
Round 9: same
Round 10: he got a majority correct, so he's probably not playing the first version unless he's really lucky. he got some wrong so he can't be playing the third version. he's probably playing the 2nd version.
-- Condition 3 --
Round 1: She got it correct - chances are she was playing an easier version. 
Round 2: Same reason as before
Round 3: same as before
Round 4: If she got one wrong, she must not have been playing the easiest version. Chances go up for the second version. The first version is still somewhat unlikely because she got three consecutively correct.
Round 5: same
Round 6: same reason as that given for round 4
Round 7: same
Round 8: same

Round 10: she got more correct than incorrect but she still had some incorrect answers so chances are that she was playing the second version of the game.

Round 2: same reason.
Round 3: same reason. 
Round 4: same reason.
Round 5:  chances that anna would have made the second and third boxes look alike by the fifth round are pretty good, so the fact that they have all been different so far decreases the chances that she is playing version 1. 
Round 6: same reason as before.
Round 7: same reason 
Round 8: same reason as before
Round 9: the chances that anna would have all three looking different when all that she needs to focus on is the difference between the second and third suggests that she is probably not playing the second version but is playing the third version.

Round 1: he could be playing any of the games. 
Round 2: same reason as before. 
Round 3: same reason as before.

Round 5: same reason
Round 6: same reason
Round 7: same reason
Round 8: at this point, after seven rounds, i would have expected to see at least one round where the third box and second box were alike if matt was playing the first verision. as that result has not yet been displayed, it's less likely that he is playing that version of the game. 
Round 9: same reason
Round 10: same reason as before. if he were playing version 1 - he would probably have had the second and third boxes look the same at least once in 10 rounds. 
-- Condition 3 --
Round 1: she could be playing any of the versions because the shape in the third box is different from the 2nd box (fulfilling the requirement for the second version) and is different from the first and second boxes (fulfilling the requirement for the third version). 
Round 2: same reason
Round 3: same reason
Round 4: highly unlikely she was playing the third version because the shapes are not all different. it could be either the first or the second.

Round 8: "
Round 9: "
Round 10: winning 6 out of 10 coin flips seems more impressive in this game than it would in real life. not enough to convince me that he screwed up the three box game 4 times, however. 2 boxes it is.
-- Condition 3 --
Round 1: starting out with a 3 would be lucky for 1 box, a coin flip for 2, and easy for 3. we'll see how this progresses
Round 2: just over 10 % chance for doing that with 1 box.... it could make a comeback though
Round 3: now at 3% for 1 box and 12.5% for 2....
Round 4: lucky streak for 2 boxes? still seems unlikely for 1
Round 5: i'm not sure how you mess up with 3 open boxes, but if it's 2 this guy is really lucky and if it's one he should give up his day job and go to a casino
Round 6: another mistake makes me think he's just a really lucky 2 box guesser
Round 7: it's too difficult to screw up 3 boxes this often, so this guy has luck with coinflips. or.... did. luck going down now.
Round 8: um really?
Round 9: too many mistakes in 3 before, but the mistake in 2 has me wondering a bit.
Round 10: i don't know what happened in 8, but there is under a 1% chance of this having happened with 1 window, so 2 it is.

Round 5: benefit of the doubt i suppose
Round 6: and now it's gone
Round 7: consistent with two different shapes. i don't think 3 boxes stands a chance anymore
Round 8: same as before
Round 9: thought about giving him another benefit of the doubt, but those 3 rounds in a row make it unlikely
Round 10: 100% for the 2 different shapes, obviously so for the one, and only 60% for the 3 different shapes makes 2 boxes seem likely
-- Condition 3 --
Round 1: This follows the rules of the 3 open box, making it most likely
Round 2: same as before
Round 3: The consistency of the 3 different shapes leads me to prefer the 3 open box game type
Round 4: and no longer, with this sudden shift to a two box victory (the one box option is still likely, and assuming susan didn't just make a mistake, the 3 box is out of the question)
Round 5: maybe round 4 was a mistake?
Round 6: maybe not
Round 7: probably not
Round 8: Susan just likes circles and squares doesn't she...
Round 9: again, possibility of a mistake, but i think the 3 open boxes are still pretty unlikely.
Round 10: there were enough rounds of 3 different shapes for that to stand a chance, and only one round where the 2 open boxes were wrong, but it's still a simple game and mistakes aren't expected.

=== Subject 29: Utility, Condition order: [1 3 2] ===
-- Condition 1 --
Round 1: Since she can choose any shape when all the boxes are closed, it is 1/3 chance she could chosen the circle.                        
Round 2: If all the boxes were closed, she could have chosen any shape and since she chose a circle before, it is likely that she could have just chosen circle as before.
Round 3: As she chose trianle which is right all the shapes had to have shown to get this.

Round 5: As for considering only one shape is shown she doesn't follow a pattern of choosing this trianlge so it is unlikely that only one shape was shown.
Round 6: Now since she choose a square, it is somewhat likely for none of the shape was shown and only one shape was shown because she chose square after a triangle as a pattern 
Round 7: following no pattern it is almost unlikely that none of the frame is open
Round 8: It is very likely for choosing the circle following her pattern as before
Round 9: Same as before
Round 10: Since she chose a triangle which was same as before she could have just clicked on it again which is very likely for all three cases. 
-- Condition 2 --
Round 1: Very likely to choose the right shape when all the boxes are open and 1/2 chance for one box is open and 1/3 chance of all boxes being closed.
Round 2: It is very likely to choose a circle for all cases just clicking the same shape as before
Round 3: If it was the case for one box open and none being open it would be more likely to choose a circle as before but she chose a squre which is unlikely
Round 4: Since it was wrong, it can't be all boxes being open and somewhat ikely for him to choose when none or one box is open as he picked the square before and just clicked on it
Round 5: She have chosen two circles and two squres and this time started to choose a triangle so perhaps she is following a pattern
Round 6: It is for sure that all the boxes were closed since she got it wrong, and very likely for the other two as explained before she is following a pattern
Round 7: Same reasoning as before
Round 8: If none of the boxes were open looking at her record she should have picked the square so it is very unlikely
Round 9: Since she got it right and following the previous pattern, it is very likely for all three cases
Round 10: Same as before
-- Condition 3 --
Round 1: Since he got it right, it is very likely for all shapes being shown and somewhat for showing one shape(50/50 chance) and 1/3 chance for all shapes being covered.
Round 2: For all the shapes were covered he could have chosen anything and he chose circle which is closer to the submit button so he could have just clicked on it.
Round 3: Now considering all shapes are closed he could click on any shape 1/3 chance but the circle could be conveniant but chose the trianle so unlikely
Round 4: Since he didn't choose a triangle it is very unlikely that all the shapes were shown.                                                                                                                       
Round 5: he got it right so it is very likeable for him to choose the square.                          
Round 6: He got it wrong, very unlikeable that all the shapes were shown.                                                              
Round 7: If none or only one shape was to be shown it is almost likeable for both cases since the circle is very close to the submit button. easy to click on it
Round 8: For this case it only has to be none of the shape to be chosen because if the one shape was to be shown it had to be a triangle or a circle not the square. 
Round 9: Since he got it right all the shapes should be shown. If the only shape is shown it is somewhat likely to choose the square as he can choose a trianlge but he has a pattern of just choosing what he have chose previously. Same patter for choosing a square for all the boxes being closed
Round 10: Trianlge being shown it could have been circle being convinient but he tended to choose a square when the middle one was open to be a trianlge.
